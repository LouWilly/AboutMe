    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Aleks.
\n\nI love fish.
\n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
\nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
\n And sometimes I even go fishing.
\n And even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
\n\n Once, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
\n\n I'll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
\nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n</string>
